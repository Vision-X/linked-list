<h2>Approach</h2>
<p>We met initially to discuss the project and organize work. We established a GitHub repo early in the project, and integrated waffle.io for issue management using the Kanban board.
After establishing the HTML skeleton, we worked independently to style portions of the page, merging our branches on GitHub. With initial styling complete, we used driver-navigatoring pairing style to build the jquery for page functionality. We managed each phase of the project with the Kanban board, working only on posted issues and committing frequently as issues passed testing.
We discussed all required changes that varied from the given comp as we progressed through the phases. We decided hiding the "Clear All Read" button on load established a simple flow. Once a card was added, the appearance of the button and counters provided clues to the user of the additional functionality of the app. When a user added enough cards to be overflow the page, the scroll bar appears and shifts the cards slightly. We considered adjusting the CSS to remove the shift, but decided the shift provides a visual clue to the scroll bar needed to view all cards.
